* Updated Logitech SDK to v3.01 (driver 8.00.100)

* Updated Basque, German, Russian, Simplified Chinese and Ukrainian translations
* More resilient support for MPL2 and SRT subtitles formats:
  - Ticket #2779, Support MicroDVD tags in MPL2 subtitles files. This is normally not
    supported but MPL2 files that use MicroDVD tags for formatting are quite common.
  - Support SRT files with missing millisecond part in the timecodes.
! Ticket #2423, Fix wrong rounding leading to small black bars when resizing the window.
  This was mostly visible when using the "auto-fit" zoom or when resizing manually.
! Ticket #2783, Fix crash when generating the chapter marks.
